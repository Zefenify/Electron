Web Music player app for [ArifZefen](http://www.arifzefen.com)

UI/UX inspired by Spotify, iTunes and ArifZefen API

## Usage / Installation
The app **must be open in HTTP** not HTTPS as ArifZefn server API is served only through HTTP

You also need CORS plug-in so Wolf-Cola can bypass CORS restrictions and access ArifZefen's API
